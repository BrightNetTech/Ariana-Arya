SWOT analysis pros and cons
Advantages of using a SWOT approach are the following:
The analysis creates a visual representation of the factors that are most likely to impact whether the business, project, initiative or individual can successfully achieve an objective.
By involving experienced cross-discipline team members, a SWOT analysis can encourage many different perspectives and approaches.
Such diversity can allow a SWOT analysis to flesh out each element and expose creative ideas and overlooked problems that might otherwise go unnoticed.
SWOT analysis does have limits, such as the following:
The analysis may not include all relevant factors because some strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats can easily be overlooked or misunderstood.
The input for each element can often be empirical or subjective and give a skewed perspective.
Because it only captures factors at a particular point in time and doesn't allow for how those factors could change over time, the insight SWOT offers can have a limited shelf life.
